      Within the tennis community, players and coaches are consumed with
      statistics and percentages as they seek strategies that will give them the
      highest chance at outplaying their opponent. Unfortunately, statistics are
      hard to come by and often coaches or parents will have to purchase
      subscriptions so that they can adequately track matches. This is the issue
      “Courtside Companion” seeks to resolve–a free to use, tennis statistics
      tracker that can be utilized by teams or individual players alike.

      “Courtside Companion” is a webapp that can be used via laptop or phone and
      is designed to be easy to use. As spectators watch a match, they can
      simply click buttons and prompts to describe the outcome of each point.
      With many point characteristics being optional, spectators have
      flexibility in the type of data they record. Example core data collections
      include serving performance, unforced errors, winners, and rally length. A
      key function of “Courtside Companion” is its compatibility with teams who
      can share a login and aggregate both team and individual statistics over
      time.

      After appropriate data is collected, “Courtside Companion” populates a
      report with percentages of the data fields collected. This report will
      allow players to compare their performance over time and isolate key
      issues in their playstyle. In addition, coaches can look at their team to
      identify what issues their team might be struggling with.
